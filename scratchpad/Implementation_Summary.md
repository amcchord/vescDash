# VESC BLE Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **BLE Scanning**
   - Filters for devices with "VESC" in the name
   - Displays device name, MAC address, and RSSI
   - Visual device selection with highlighting

2. **Enhanced BLE Connection**
   - Client callbacks for connection monitoring
   - Tries both RANDOM and PUBLIC address types
   - Proper stabilization delays (2 seconds after connection)
   - Service discovery with detailed error reporting
   - Lists all available services if Nordic UART not found

3. **Notification Setup**
   - Registers for notifications on TX characteristic
   - Writes to CCCD descriptor (0x2902) to ensure notifications
   - Proper error handling if characteristics not found

4. **VESC Communication**
   - CRC16 implementation for packet validation
   - Packet construction with proper format
   - Tests connection with COMM_ALIVE before data requests
   - Sends COMM_GET_VALUES for voltage data
   - Auto-refresh every 3 seconds when connected

5. **User Interface**
   - Loading screen on startup
   - Device list with selection indicator
   - Real-time voltage display when connected
   - Button controls for navigation and actions

## Connection Improvements Made

### Based on Research:

1. **Address Type Handling**
   ```c
   // Try RANDOM first (most common for VESC BLE modules)
   pClient->connect(bleAddress, BLE_ADDR_TYPE_RANDOM)
   // Fallback to PUBLIC if RANDOM fails
   pClient->connect(bleAddress, BLE_ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC)
   ```

2. **Connection Callbacks**
   ```c
   class MyClientCallbacks : public BLEClientCallbacks {
       void onConnect(BLEClient* pclient);
       void onDisconnect(BLEClient* pclient);
   };
   ```

3. **Critical Delays**
   - 2000ms after connection (stabilization)
   - 1000ms after notification setup
   - 500ms after COMM_ALIVE test

4. **Descriptor Writing**
   ```c
   // Ensure notifications are enabled at descriptor level
   BLERemoteDescriptor* pDescriptor = pTX->getDescriptor(0x2902);
   uint8_t notifyValue[] = {0x01, 0x00};
   pDescriptor->writeValue(notifyValue, 2, true);
   ```

## Debugging Output

The Serial Monitor will show:
1. Connection attempt with address type
2. Connection success/failure
3. Service discovery results
4. Characteristic discovery
5. Notification setup
6. COMM_ALIVE test
7. Data packets sent/received
8. Parsed voltage values

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### If Connection Still Fails:

1. **Check VESC Configuration**
   - UART must be enabled in VESC Tool
   - Baud rate should be 115200
   - App Settings -> UART -> Enable

2. **Verify BLE Module**
   - Must be NRF51/NRF52 based
   - Must be in UART bridge mode
   - Check if module requires pairing

3. **Debug with Serial Monitor**
   - Look for "Failed with RANDOM address"
   - Check "Available services" list
   - Verify Nordic UART Service UUID

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Reconnection Logic**
   - Auto-reconnect on disconnect
   - Connection state management

2. **Data Parsing**
   - Parse full COMM_GET_VALUES response
   - Display RPM, current, temperature

3. **Control Features**
   - Send throttle commands
   - Set current limits
   - Configure VESC parameters

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Graphical voltage display
   - Historical data graphs
   - Multiple device support

## Testing Procedure

1. **Upload Code**
   ```bash
   platformio run --target upload
   ```

2. **Open Serial Monitor**
   ```bash
   platformio device monitor
   ```

3. **Test Sequence**
   - Power on VESC with BLE module
   - Watch scan results
   - Select VESC device
   - Monitor connection process
   - Check for voltage display

4. **Troubleshooting**
   - If stuck at "Connecting...": Check address type in Serial
   - If "Service not found": VESC BLE may not have Nordic UART
   - If no data received: Check notification setup in Serial
